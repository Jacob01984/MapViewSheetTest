# Project Overview
I recently started a new Project that involves maps and navigation, one of my main focus of the app is to have that native IOS Maps look. 
As I started designing the UI, I found the bottom sheet from maps to be a bit challenging. It took more that just adding a .sheet and presenting it to the user.
In this repo, you will find a file named bottomSheet.swift under folder "ViewExtensions", This is the custom sheet that gave me the ability to present the sheet at all times, while
keeping background Interactivity.
